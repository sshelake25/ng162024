https://angular.io/guide/view-encapsulation

In Angular, View Encapsulation is a mechanism that encapsulates the styles of a component, preventing them from affecting the styles of other components. It allows you to define styles for a component without worrying about global style pollution or conflicts. Angular provides three types of view encapsulation: Emulated (default), Shadow DOM, and None.

### 1. Emulated View Encapsulation (Default):

In emulated view encapsulation, Angular emulates the Shadow DOM using a combination of CSS classes and attributes. It appends a unique attribute to the HTML elements of the component and uses this attribute to scope the styles. This ensures that the styles of one component do not interfere with the styles of other components.

To use emulated view encapsulation, don't specify the `ViewEncapsulation` explicitly (as it is the default behavior):

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: '<p>This is an example component with emulated view encapsulation</p>',
})
export class ExampleComponent {}
```

### 2. Shadow DOM View Encapsulation:

Angular supports using the Shadow DOM if the browser supports it. In this mode, Angular uses the browser's native Shadow DOM to encapsulate the styles. This provides true style isolation, but not all browsers support Shadow DOM.

To use Shadow DOM view encapsulation, specify it explicitly in the `@Component` decorator:

```typescript
import { Component, ViewEncapsulation } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: '<p>This is an example component with Shadow DOM view encapsulation</p>',
  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom,
})
export class ExampleComponent {}
```

### 3. None View Encapsulation:

In none view encapsulation, Angular does not perform any encapsulation. Styles defined in the component will affect the global styles. Use this cautiously, as it can lead to potential style conflicts.

To use none view encapsulation, specify it explicitly in the `@Component` decorator:

```typescript
import { Component, ViewEncapsulation } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: '<p>This is an example component with no view encapsulation</p>',
  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None,
})
export class ExampleComponent {}
```

### Summary:

- **Emulated (Default):** Ensures style encapsulation using a combination of CSS classes and attributes.
  
- **Shadow DOM:** Provides true style isolation if the browser supports Shadow DOM.

- **None:** Disables view encapsulation, allowing styles to affect global styles. Use cautiously.

Choose the appropriate view encapsulation based on your project requirements and browser compatibility. Emulated view encapsulation is generally a safe default choice, providing a good balance between style encapsulation and compatibility.
